# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished 1 out of 5 challenges under APIs and Microservices which is *Managing Packages with NPM*.

**Thoughts:** While working on the package.json file, I was amazed that I learned about SemVer (Semantic Versioning). It is an industry standard for software versioning. I've been working on several projects and didn't realize until now the importance of package.json file in the project, on how it is read and its functionality. I also learned using tilde and caret character to keep updated on a dependency.

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Express Server, serving static assets, and serving JSON on a specific route. Not familiar in all of these since I'm mainly a PHP person.

**Thoughts:** I'm very new to Express JS, it is my first time to learn new stuff beyond PHP.
